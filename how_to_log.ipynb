    "# Logging in python\n",
    "You know when you have coded your biggest project and every time it runs you can barely figure out what is doing only by reading a series of print statements and the creation of strategically saved files?\n",
    "Well if that is the case, you ought to learn logging and step up your game. \n",
    "With a proper system of logging. you will have a consistent, ordered and a more reliable way to understand your own code, to time and track its progression and capture bugs easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the advantages of logging:\n",
    "1.\tFormatting: Logging allows you to standardize every message using a format of your choosing.\n",
    "2.\tTime tracking: Alongside the message you can add the time when it is generated. \n",
    "3.\tCompact: All messages are gathered in files, you don’t need to scroll up continuously. \n",
    "4.\tVersatility: Print do not works everywhere (i.e., objects without __str__ methods).\n",
    "5.\tFlexibility: Logging allows different levels of importance to your messages so you regulate what to show.\n",
    "With all of this, you won’t be the only one who can understand your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start!\n",

    "## Functions of logging\n",
    "“logging” is a standard library of python, therefore, you won’t need to install it. Simply type\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "And you are good to go.\n",
    "At its core there are only five functions of logging that we are going to use all the times, those are:\n",
    "- logging.debug and logging.info: Conceptually, These two are the closest to a normal print. They report events following the normal run of a program.\n",
    "    - Logging.info: It’s meant to confirm that things are working as expected.\n",
    "    - Logging.debug: These are messages expected to arise during debugging and it should carry detailed information.\n",
    "- Logging.warning: This is a low level error message, meaning that there is an issue present that won’t stop the flow of the program but it has to be noted by the user.\n",
    "- logging.error: This message is meant when an issue has arisen that won’t allow the program to execute some functions, but it won’t stop the program. \n",
    "- logging.critical: This the highest level of error messages. A critical means that a serious issue is present and the program may stop.\n",

    "These levels of severity are: \n",

    " \n",
    "It is good practice to define a new name of the class logger, in your code. Indeed, you can customize your logger and adapt to the needs of your project.\n",
    " \n",
    "Commonly a logger is configured using:\n",
    "- logger.setLevel() set the the lowest severity for the log messages similarly to what we have seen with basicConfig()\n",
    "- logging.Formatter(): How to format the messages\n",
    "- logger.addHandler() and Logger.removeHandler() add and remove handler objects from the logger object. \n",
    "- logger.addFilter() and Logger.removeFilter() add and remove filter objects from the logger object. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Handler\n",
    "Handlers are used to send the logs to one or more output destinations. Each logger can have more than one handler. And like with loggers you can configure the level of severity of a message, formats, etc.\n",
    "Therefore, in each project you can have more than one logger, dealing with different parts and more than one handlers to deal with one or more logging files.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Formatter\n",
    "Like we saw with basicConfig() we can format our messages in different ways obtaining different string formats.\n",
    "There are many other classes (e.g.: Filters) but I’ll leave to you to explore there more let’s see now an example: \n",
